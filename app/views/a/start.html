        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">About this assessment</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">This assessment asks you to agree or disagree with statements about yourself.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">We’ll use your answers to suggest types of jobs you might be suited to.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How long will it take</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">There are 40 questions.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The assessment will take 5 minutes to complete.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You can save your assessment to complete it or look at your results again another time.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to respond</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">A lot of the statements are about how you are at work. If you have not had a job yet, think how you are with your friends and family.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Some of the statements are very similar. Try to answer honestly, even if you think you’ve see a statement before.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You will get more accurate results if you respond to every statement. But if you cannot respond, you can choose ‘This does not apply to me’.</p>
